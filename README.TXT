Project "figures"

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition

It is discussed in chapter 1.

This is a very simple project to demonstrate some characteristics of
objects.

You can create various shapes, and you will see, if you do, that those
shapes are drawn on screen (in a window that we call the "canvas").

You can then manipulate these objects: change their position, size and 
colour. Try it out: create a few different squares, triangles and circles.

This project is designed as a first example of object-oriented programming.
It illustrates a number of concepts:

 - a Java project (application) is a collection of classes
 - objects can be created from classes
 - from any one class, many objects may be created
 - objects have operations (methods)
 - operations can have parameters
 - parameters have types (at least String and int)
 - objects hold data (fields)
 - the operations and fields are common to all objects
 - the values stored in the fields can be different for each object

The project also demonstrates



 - BlueJ object creation
 - interactive method invocation
 - parameter passing

A good second project to look at after this is "picture", which adds a class
to those ones in this project. That class (named "Picture") uses the shapes
to draw a picture. It can be used to experiment with coding.

**********-Answers to lab questions-**************
Question#2: If i call moveDown twice the object that i tell to moveDown will
move down twice, and if i call makeInvisible twice then the object that i
call to make invisble twice then it won't chance anything.

Question#6: When writing a color into the parameter feild without the quotes
it shows an error saying it in invalid and it can't find that variable.

Question#9: I started with making all the shapes i needed and making them the
right color. First i ajusted the size of the square and placed it in the 
middle of the surface, then put the black window over the house and same with
the roof. Then moved the sun to the right and in the sky. It is faily simple
so there is probably only 1 or 2 ways to do it but i think the way i did it
was the most efficent.
